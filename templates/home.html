A rich source of information on the workings of New York City finance, the history of American capitalism, and the role of "Northern" banks in the transatlantic slave trade, the Brown Brothers Collection has been vastly underutilized, in part because it is written in nineteenth-century longhand.<br/><br/>In collaboration with NYPL, the team at NewYorkScapes is looking to change that. As we work on exploring the uses of machine learning and custom OCR for unlocking the potential of this collection, we're building a database of human-transcribed pages from the Brown Brothers ledgers to serve as reference and training data, as well as to inform historical research and pedagogy.</p>
